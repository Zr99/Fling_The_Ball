# Fling_The_Ball - (Android Studio)
The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate the Android skills I have developed by developing a larger application, bringing together a number of Android features.
___
This is a game-based application that utilizes most of the concepts  
about Android development and the object structures. The basic idea is to build an
application in which users 'throw' balls at targets.
\
##  Description
* The application includes a ‘Home’ screen, a ‘Game Play’ screen, and a ‘High
Score’ screen
* The ‘Home’ screen shows the name of the game, the names of the developer
name, and have a 'start play' button.
* The ‘Game Play’ screen is full screen and implements the ball game
described below (in the ‘game play description’ section). It has a scoring
system showing a point count on screen and some kind of win/lose system so that a
game can finish
* The ‘High Score’ screen shows the 5 best scores achieved.
\
## Game play description
* You should use the “fling” gesture to throw a ball at a target. You can take into
account direction, speed, and possibly curve or spin to determine ball movement.
* There is a limit for the gesture so as not to allow the user to drag the ball all the way to
a target.
* There are two obstacles. The
obstacles will affect the throw in some way.
